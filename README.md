# Solutions for MLAPP
This project includes my solutions to the book [*Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Patrick Murphy when I was learning this book.

The solutions are written in the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) format `.ipynb`, which supports python/markdown cells with pretty output. Solutions are written in markdown cells with Mathjax extension for equations. 

## Read online
As long as you do not need to modify it, you do not have to install Jupyter Notebook. Desktop version site of Github also supports `ipynb`. But unfortunately, it looks bad and does not support predefined macros, which make it only a fallback or a fast preview. 

+ [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/peijunz/mlapp/tree/master/) is an official online viewer for read only purpose. 
+ [my blog](https://peijunz.github.io/category/mlapp.html) also has html generated for this project.
