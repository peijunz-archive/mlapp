# Solutions for MLAPP
This project includes my solutions to the book [*Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Patrick Murphy when I was learning this book.

The solutions are written in the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) format `.ipynb`, which supports python/markdown cells with pretty output. Solutions are written in markdown cells with Mathjax extension for equations. 

## How to read?
As long as you do not need to modify it, you do not have to install Jupyter Notebook. There is an official online viewer for read only purpose. The viewer page for this project is [here!](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/peijunz/mlapp/tree/master/)
