# Solutions for MLAPP
This project includes my solutions to the book [*Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective*](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Patrick Murphy when I was learning this book.

The solutions are written in the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) format `.ipynb`, which supports python/markdown cells with pretty output. Solutions are written in markdown cells with Mathjax extension for equations. 

## Read online at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/peijunz/mlapp/tree/master/)!
As long as you do not need to modify it, you do not have to install Jupyter Notebook. nbviewer is an official online viewer for read only purpose. 

Desktop version site of Github also supports `ipynb`. But unfortunately, it looks bad and does not support predefined macros, which make it only a fallback or a fast preview.
